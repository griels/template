Ellis is a hard-working person with strong engineering skills who takes pride in his work. He acquires new knowledge swiftly and is never afraid of dealing with the most daunting task with very little supervision. I saw him flourish when he was confronted with a project of massive proportions, where he had to start from zero and ended up designing an innovative, flexible and versatile state-of-the-art system.Ellis is passionate about human language technologies and eager to learn more and work on natural language processing. Apart from a brilliant engineer he is a great person, respectful and kind.I am very confident that he will be an asset to whatever company has the opportunity to hire him.",
